## Roadmap

We’re building a future-proof security solution for Odoo. Here's the path ahead:

### ♻️ Short-Term Enhancements
- **Scheduled Scans**: Automate security checks periodically.
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Further optimize scan state transitions and visibility.

### 🛡️ Immediate Next Step
**✨ Module Code Vulnerability Scanner ✨** (highest priority!)
- Implement a new dedicated model that scans custom and third-party modules for vulnerabilities, including:
  - SQL injection risks
  - XSS vulnerabilities
  - Unsafe file access practices
  - Misconfigured access controls

> ⚡ **This is the next major evolution**: From system configuration scanning to **actual codebase security auditing**.

### 🤖 Mid-Term Goals
- **Custom Security Check Builder**: Allow users to define and run their own security policies.
- **Advanced Rule Audit**: Deep inspection of ACLs and model-level permissions.
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Exportable, printable scan reports for security audits and compliance tracking.

### 🦿 Long-Term Vision
- **LLM-Powered Insight Engine**: Use AI to interpret scan results, suggest mitigations, and provide dynamic risk analysis.
- **Live CVE Detection**: Real-time scanning against known vulnerabilities in Odoo core and modules.
