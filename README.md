# Odoo Security Scanner Suite

## Overview

The Odoo Security Scanner Suite is an Odoo module designed to help administrators assess the security posture of their Odoo instances.  It performs checks for several key security configurations and provides a report of the findings.

## Features

-   **Basic Security Checks:**
    -   Checks if a master password is set.
    -   Checks if the Odoo instance is running over HTTPS.
    -   Checks if access rules are defined for all models.
    -   Checks if a log file is present.
    -   Checks if a database filter is set.
    -   Checks if database listing is disabled.
-   **Scan Management:**
    -   Create and manage security scan records.
    -   View scan results in an Odoo form.
    -   Initiate scans from the user interface.
-   **User Interface:**
    -   Provides list and form views for managing scans.
    -   Adds a "Security Scan" menu to access the module's functionality.

## Installation

1.  Place the `security_scanner_suite` directory in your Odoo addons path.
2.  Install the module from the Odoo web interface.

## Usage

## Roadmap

### Future Enhancements

-   **CVE Scanning:** Integrate a security scanner to check the Odoo core for known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).
-   **Module Code Scanning:** Implement a feature to scan the code of newly installed modules for potential security issues.  This could include checks for:
    -   SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    -   Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    -   Insecure file handling.
    -   Authentication and authorization issues.
-   **LLM Integration:** Integrate with a Large Language Model (LLM) API to:
    -   Process scan results and provide more detailed analysis.
    -   Suggest mitigation strategies for identified security issues.
    -   Generate comprehensive security reports.
-   **Automated Scans:** Add the ability to schedule scans.
-   **Email Notifications:** Configure email notifications to send scan reports to administrators.
-   **Customizable Checks:** Allow administrators to define custom security checks.
-   **Detailed Reporting:** Improve the reporting functionality to provide more detailed and actionable information.
