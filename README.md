## Roadmap

We‚Äôre building a forward-thinking security layer for Odoo. Here‚Äôs where we‚Äôre heading:

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Short-Term Enhancements
- **Scheduled Scans**: Automate security checks on a periodic basis.
- **Scan State Improvements**: Better tracking of ongoing and completed scans to optimize UI visibility.

### üõ°Ô∏è Mid-Term Goals
- **Custom Check Builder**: Let users define organization-specific checks.
- **Detailed Rule Audit**: Deeper access control coverage with rule source tracking.
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Exportable and filterable scan summaries for audits and compliance.

### ü§ñ Long-Term Vision
- **LLM-Driven Insight**: Use AI to interpret results, recommend mitigations, and generate security audit summaries.
- **CVE Detection Engine**: Cross-reference your Odoo version against a live CVE database.
- **Module Code Scanner**: Analyze custom or third-party modules for common security risks:
  - SQL injections
  - XSS vulnerabilities
  - Unsafe file access patterns
  - Misconfigured access groups
